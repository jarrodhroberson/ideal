#IDEAL

IDEAL is an attempt at merging the best features of functional programming with a flexible declarative type system for compile time type safety and to make creating an intelligent IDE and lint system easy.

The goal of the project is to make a extremely minimalistic syntax and language that can be used to make much more powerful constructs and language features inside the language.

I know what everyone is thinking now, "They already did this with Lisp!"

My answer is "Yes, but ..." I am focusing on a much more readable syntax that is more explicit and doesn't have the parenthesis cancer that Lisp has.
